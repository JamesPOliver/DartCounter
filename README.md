# DartCounter
A program to add up darts scores, taking the burden from the user.
Just a thing I'm writing to practise Python and make playing darts a little easier for myself, as I can't add up the scores quickly.

Update: The next step for this will be cleaning up, adding a UI using Tkinter, and turning it to an executable file.
