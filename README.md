# DartCounter
A program to add up darts scores, taking the burden from the user.
Just a thing I'm writing to practise Python and make playing darts a little easier for myself, as I can't add up the scores quickly.
If anyone is even reading this at this point, I'm adapting this to Java and planning to have a GUI if I can implement that.
